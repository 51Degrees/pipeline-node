This series of examples illustrates how to:
1. Create a simple flow element that determines star sign for a given date.
2. Build on this to use a data file as a lookup (with automatic update functionality).
3. Return some JavaScript to be executed on the client device. Use the built-in capabilities of the Pipeline to consume the evidence that is generated.
